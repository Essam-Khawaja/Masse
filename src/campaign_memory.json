      "summary": "The campaign begins in the quaint village of Oakhaven, nestled in the Whisperwind Dale, a secluded part of the Silver Marches. Strange phenomena are plaguing the region: the forests are becoming unnaturally dark and twisted, animals are aggressive and sickly, and a creeping, grey fungus, dubbed 'Gloom-Weave,' is slowly devouring the natural world. The party must investigate these disturbing events, contain the immediate threats, and discover the local source of the blight. (Party Levels 1-4)",

        "description": "While investigating a particularly corrupted section of the Whispering Woods, the party encounters a once-majestic young treant, now grotesquely bloated and covered in the Gloom-Weave. It lashes out with corrupted branches and emits sickly spores, determined to protect the source of its corruption.",
        "twist": "The treant is bound to a dying dryad who is trapped within its core; defeating the treant without saving the dryad will release a burst of concentrated Gloom-Weave energy, causing a temporary magical desolation in the area and attracting more blight-creatures. A successful Wisdom (Medicine) or Intelligence (Arcana) check might reveal a way to sever the dryad's connection non-lethally, offering a path to salvation instead of destruction."

      "title": "Act II: Tracing the Twisted Roots",
      "summary": "The localized outbreaks in Oakhaven prove to be just the tendrils of a far larger problem. The party learns that similar, but more severe, blights are appearing across the Silver Marches and beyond. Their investigations lead them to suspect an ancient, magical origin, possibly tied to the lost Netherese Empire. They must travel to a major city like Silverymoon to seek knowledge and then delve into forgotten ruins to pinpoint the true source of the burgeoning Gloom-Weave. (Party Levels 5-8)",

        "description": "Deep within the Netherese ruin of Aerith'dun, the party disturbs an ancient magical construct, a guardian animated and corrupted by the Gloom-Weave. This hulking automaton attacks with powerful, blighted fists and can project localized fields of magical dissonance, protecting a vital clue or artifact.",
        "twist": "The construct is powered by a network of pulsating Gloom-Weave tendrils that also bind four smaller, weaker 'Gloom-Servitor' constructs. Destroying the servitors weakens the main construct significantly, but each one explodes into a cloud of debilitating spores (Constitution saving throw vs. poison/exhaustion) upon defeat. The construct has a central weak point that only becomes vulnerable after two servitors are destroyed, forcing the party to manage multiple threats simultaneously."

      "title": "Act III: The Heart of the Gloom",
      "summary": "With clues gathered from the ancient ruins, the party uncovers the horrifying truth: the Gloom-Weave is a sentient magical entity, a catastrophic byproduct of a failed Netherese arch-wizard's attempt to merge raw arcane energy with life force. It has been dormant for millennia, slowly consuming ambient magic, and is now fully awakening within a hidden, extra-dimensional pocket located deep beneath the Silver Marches. The party must journey into its core, confront its insidious will, and find a way to sever its connection to the Weave or destroy it entirely. (Party Levels 9-12)",

        "description": "In the heart of the Nexus, the party faces the Gloom-Weave Incarnate: a swirling, formless entity of purple and black energy, tendrils of arcane blight lashing out. It attacks with powerful magical assaults, siphoning life and magic, and warping reality around it, seeking to consume all it touches.",
        "twist": "The battle takes place within an unstable extra-dimensional pocket where the boundaries between planes are thin. At the start of each round, roll a d4: 1-2 (Anti-Magic Field: all spells fail), 3 (Wild Magic Surge: a random magical effect from the Wild Magic Surge table), 4 (Weave Overload: all spellcasters regain one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower, but also take 2d6 force damage). Furthermore, the Incarnate attempts to mentally corrupt one party member per round, offering them immense power if they betray their companions and allow the Gloom-Weave to consume Faer\u00fbn."
